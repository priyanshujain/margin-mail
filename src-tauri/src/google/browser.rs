// Where the consent page is shown on a phone, and how it is taken away again.
//
// Desktop hands the URL to the system browser and forgets about it. The loopback listener is the
// only thing that has to survive, and a desktop process keeps running perfectly well while another
// window has focus. A phone does not work that way: sending the user out to Safari or Chrome
// backgrounds this process, iOS suspends it, and a suspended process accepts nothing on its socket,
// so the redirect carrying the authorization code arrives at nobody.
//
// So the consent page is put in front of the app instead, by the system's own browser component.
// Never a WebView this app owns: Google blocks that outright with `disallowed_useragent`, and it
// deserves to be blocked, because a webview the app controls can read what is typed into it. What
// this app gets in return for not owning it is to stay foreground, with its listener still
// accepting, for as long as consent takes.
//
// Three surfaces, because the platforms do not offer the same thing.
//
//   Chrome Custom Tab, Android. Chrome itself, so it reads Chrome's cookie jar and an account
//   already signed in there is offered by name. Nothing else is needed on Android.
//
//   SFSafariViewController, iOS, when there is no `ios` OAuth client. Safari's engine, but with
//   storage of this app's own since iOS 11, so the user signs in from scratch inside it. It works
//   with no console setup at all, which is the only reason to accept that.
//
//   ASWebAuthenticationSession, iOS, when there is one. The only iOS surface that shares Safari's
//   session, and the one to prefer, but it intercepts a custom scheme and never an http loopback
//   redirect, so it is reachable only where an `ios` client has bought a scheme.
//
// The first two are `open`/`close`: they know nothing about the answer, so the loopback listener
// stays the thing that decides an attempt is over, and the two flags below carry the one fact it
// cannot see for itself. `authenticate` is the third and reports its own outcome.
