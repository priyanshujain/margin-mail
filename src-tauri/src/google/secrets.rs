// Where refresh tokens live: an encrypted file in the app's data directory, on every platform.
// Never plaintext on disk, never in the SQLite store, never in `accounts.json`, one entry per
// account id.
//
// This is the calendar's store, and it used to be the OS credential store with this file as a
// fallback. That is gone. The credential stores did not survive contact with five platforms:
//
//   macOS    Keychain ties an item's ACL to the code signature, so an ad-hoc signed build gets a
//            new identity on every compile and macOS correctly re-asks for authorization every
//            single time. An authorization dialog a minute is not something to ask anyone to live
//            with, so macOS was already excluded before mobile came up at all.
//   Android  The keyring crate has no Android backend. There is nothing to fall back from.
//   Linux    A minimal window manager often runs no Secret Service daemon, so the fallback ran
//            anyway on exactly the machines that most wanted the daemon.
//
// That left one real implementation and four ways of reaching it, so the branching went and the
// file stayed. Be clear about what it is worth, because it is not the same everywhere:
//
//   iOS, Android  The app sandbox is the boundary. Another app cannot read this file, so the
//                 encryption is defence in depth over a boundary the OS already enforces.
//   Desktop       Anyone who can read the user's home directory can read the token. The key is
//                 derived from a salt sitting next to the ciphertext, mixed with a machine
//                 identifier, so a copied home directory does not decrypt elsewhere, and that is
//                 the whole of the protection. Better than plaintext, worse than the Secret
//                 Service, and chosen knowing that.
//
// The token is a Google refresh token scoped to one Gmail account, revocable from the user's
// Google account page, and revoked here on disconnect.
